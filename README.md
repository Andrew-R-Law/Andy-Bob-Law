- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andy-Bob-Law
- 👀 I’m interested in formal languages, web ontology, and web development more generally.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics (HTML, CSS, Java), but looking to eventually learn the works (front-end, back-end, and everything in-between).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything! 
- 📫 How to reach me: andy[dot]bob[dot]law[at]gmail.com.
